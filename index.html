				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>That cute kid on the dino is my son.  He lights up with joy at just the mention of a dinosaur.  Imagine if your personal web developer had that kind of passion and excitement about making your business a success.  I do.  I have been studying and absorbing web development since my dad bought me a book on HTML when I was 10.  I have done many freelance jobs, you can see a few in the work section. I have also held a position as the web developer for City of Flagstaff   Public Library.  And now, as I'm nearing completion of my degree in Web Design and Interactive Media, I have begun this bus si ness that will keep me developing more often.  I love the work and can't wait to meet you and get started on the project(s) you might have for me.</p>

				<h1>What I offer</h1>
				<p>Programing is changing the world every day and it can change your bus si ness in a big way.  I am passionate about using my programing skills to make others passions come alive and grow.  Not only do you need a stunning website to keep customers coming back to it, but you also need to start automating processes which means having your web site became a web application that can take a load off.  Instead of providing contact info for ordering sweets in your business, why not let customers order online.  And why not have that order generate you a list of needed supplies to fill it. Are you ready to see what a stunning website and a powerful web application can do to change your business?</p>
